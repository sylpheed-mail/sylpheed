            <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
               other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
               assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
               or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
               Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
               to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
               modifications made by others.
            </p>
            <p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
               works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
               complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
               designed for free software.
            </p>
            <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
               free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
               program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
               software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
               can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
               whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
               principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

               any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
               it can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
               grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
               that work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
               refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
               licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
               copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
               copyright law.
            </p>
            <p><a name="gfdl-mod-ver"></a>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any
               work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim,
               or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
            </p>
            <p><a name="gfdl-secnd-sect"></a>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or
               a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
               relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
               Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing
               that could fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the
               Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may
               not explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
               historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
               legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
               regarding them.
            </p>
            <p><a name="gfdl-inv-sect"></a>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary
               Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant
               Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under
               this License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
               Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The
               Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not
               identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
            </p>
            <p><a name="gfdl-cov-text"></a>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of
               text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
               notice that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
               Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at
               most 25 words.
            </p>
            <p><a name="gfdl-transparent"></a>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
               machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is
               available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
               document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
               composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
               available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
               formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
               for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent
               file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to
               thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
               Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if used for any
               substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
               "Opaque".
            </p>
            <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
               ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
               XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
               PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
               transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
               include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
               proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
               processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
               HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
               purposes only.
            </p>
            <p><a name="gfdl-title-page"></a>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book,
               the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold,
               legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
               For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
               Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's
               title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
            </p>
            <p><a name="gfdl-entitled"></a>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit
               of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
               parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language.
               (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
               "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To
               "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document
               means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this
               definition.
            </p>
            <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
               which states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
               Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
               but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
               these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
               meaning of this License.

               of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
               compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough

            <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
               have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
               Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
               copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
               Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
               cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
               publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title
               with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
               other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited
               to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
               satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
               respects.
            </p>
            <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
               legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
               reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
               pages.
            </p>
            <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
               numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
               Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
               Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
               network-using public has access to download using public-standard
               network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
               added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
               prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
               to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
               stated location until at least one year after the last time you
               distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
               of that edition to the public.
            </p>
            <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
               the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
               give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
               Document.

               copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
               of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the

               been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a

               arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may
               not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission
               from the previous publisher that added the old one.

               rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works

            <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
               distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
               Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
               permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
               translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
               original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
               translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
               Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
               the original English version of this License and the original versions
               of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between the
               translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
               disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

            <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
               "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
               Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
               title.
