<sect>What is Sylpheed?

<p>



<sect1>Introduction to Sylpheed.
<p>
Sylpheed is a fast e-mail and news client. It will run on just about any Linux or Unix compliant system.
<p>
The power of Sylpheed is that it is
<itemize>
<item>light on resources
<item>very fast
<item>intuitive for most people
<item>easy to work with
<item>loaded with features
<item>graceful and sophisticated in its interface
</itemize>
</sect1>

<sect1>Interface
<p>
The appearance and interface are similar to some popular e-mail clients for 
Windows, such as Outlook Express, Becky!, and Datula. The interface is 
also designed to emulate the mailers on Emacsen, and almost all commands 
are accessible with the keyboard.
<p>
The messages are managed by MH format, and you'll be able to use it 
together with another mailer based on MH format (like Mew). You can 
also utilize fetchmail or/and procmail, and external programs for 
receiving (like inc or imget).
</sect1>

<sect1>Main features
<p>
Currently implemented features are: 
<itemize>
<item>Unlimited multiple account handling
<item>Thread display
<item>Filtering 
<item>MIME (attachments) 
<item>built-in image view 
<item>X-Face support 
<item>External editor support 
<item>Message queueing 
<item>Draft message function 
<item>Template

<item>Newly arrived and unread message management 
<item>Multiple MH folder support 
<item>Mew/Wanderlust compatible key bindings 
<item>News reader function 
<item>Printing 
<item>UIDL support 
<item>APOP authentication

<item>Supports many locales, including UTF-8 (Unicode), when using libjconv 
<!-- added 2001/07/19 -->
<item>IMAP4 compliant
</itemize>
This list is not complete, but this will at least show you the most common features in Sylpheed.
</sect1>

<sect1>Methods for managing messages<p>
<!-- added 2001/09/06 -->
There are several ways to manage messages. The best known is <tt>not at all.</tt><p>
Too many people receive lots of e-mails and just let them end up in the INBOX folder. Which after a while becomes unmanageable. Try to locate that one mail about an important event you got 5 days ago, in a mailbox that has over 5000 messages in it. Even when sorted on date, it might take you a tremendous time to locate it.<p>
For this there are <tt>mailfolders and mailboxes.</tt><p>
When you read on in this manual, you will learn about creating mailboxes and also folders that can contain more mailboxes. What are these good for?<p>
Overview. Simple as that. In different mailboxes you can store different kinds of mails. Suppose you are a member of a kiting club. And you get at least 30 e-mails per day from that club. The smart thing to do now is to create a separate mailbox for these mails. So when an e-mail comes in from the kiting club, you can move it to the kiting club mailbox. That way you know that you have all your kiting e-mails in one place.<p>
Tedious, you say? To move 30 mails a day to that box, when they come in at random moments? You bet that is a tedious job. You can be certain that you will miss that very important one about transport to the kiting ground where you will have the contest of biggest and most beautiful kite!<p>
Well, also for this there is a solution. Those are called <tt>filters</tt>.<p>
Filters can automate the process of moving e-mails to new locations. Further on in this manual you will also learn about setting up filters, so you do not have to move these kiting e-mails to the kiting club mailbox.<p>
<sect2>Okay, so what is the difference between a mailbox and a mailfolder?<p>
This is actually the exact same thing as you do on your harddisk. You create directories in which you can put files and more directories.<p>
In the case of Sylpheed, you can create a mailbox in which you can put more mailboxes that somehow belong together. For example, you could create a mailbox (folder) that contains the mailboxes for all the mailing lists you belong to.<p>
A word of clarification is perhaps in need here. In Sylpheed, a maillbox is nothing more than a directory. And in a directory you can create a new directory. But also files. And Sylpheed stores each e-mail in a separate file on disk.
An example of how a mailbox tree could look is<p>




As you can see, there is no real limit to the way you can set up your mailboxes. As long as you have diskspace available, you can create mailboxes and mailboxes within mailboxes.<p>
Of course, you should observe some common sense when you start creating mailboxes. To keep all mail in one place is not a good idea, but to create a maze of mailboxes is not a good idea either!
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1>Features for the future<p>
This is a special chapter. As with all open source programs, many features can be requested by you, the user of Sylpheed. The best way to join in on the talks is to join one of the mailing lists on Sylpheed. For this, you can turn to the Information section of this manual and read up on how to join a mailing list.

<sect>Quick-guide to mail setup

<sect1>Starting Sylpheed for the first time

<p>
When starting Sylpheed for the first time, you will be 
guided through the first basic steps of the setup.
First a pop-up window will show up and you will be asked
to define the directory Sylpheed will use to store your
messages and folders. This directory will be created under
your home directory (or under C:\windows\Application Data\Sylpheed
on windows). The default name for this directory is "Mail".




Then the account preferences window shows up. Based on
your configuration (local UNIX mailbox or POP account),
read one of the following sections for the next steps
of the configuration.

<sect1>Setup for reading your Unix mailbox in a hurry<p>
<itemize>
<item>In the configuration menu, select "Create new account".
<item>In the <ref id="Basic"> tab, name the account. You can select this account to be the default account ("Usually used").
<item>Enter your name and e-mail address.
<item>To select your local unix mailbox, in the Protocol box you select "None (local)".
<item>When you select this option, the "Server for receiving" is greyed out, since this is not relevant. You can enter the server to send (SMTP) in this tab also.
</itemize>
Settings in the remaining tabs can usually be left at default values.




The <ref id="Receive"> tab is not used in this setup, since you are not polling a server, your mail is delivered to you.

In the <ref id="Send"> tab you can select headers and SMTP authentication.




In the <ref id="Compose"> tab you can define your signature file.




In the <ref id="Advanced"> tab you can edit the portnumbers for the servers you will be using. This normally will need no change.

This is basically everything you need to start using Sylpheed for local mailboxes. You can select "Message -> receive new mail" or press the <ref id="shortcut"> and see if there is new mail!
</sect1>
<sect1>Setup for reading POP3 mail in a hurry<p>
<itemize>
<item>In the configuration menu, select "Create new account".
<item>In the <ref id="Basic"> tab, name the account. You can select this account to be the default account ("Usually used").
<item>Enter your name and e-mail address.
<item>To check your POP3 mail, in the Protocol box you select "POP3 (normal)".
<item>Enter the server information for "Server for receiving". You can then enter the server to send (SMTP) in this tab.
</itemize>
Settings in the remaining tabs can usually be left at default values.




The <ref id="Receive"> tab offers advanced POP3 options.




In the <ref id="Send"> tab you can select headers and SMTP authentication.




In the <ref id="Compose"> tab you can define your signature file.




In the <ref id="Advanced"> tab you can edit the portnumbers for the servers you will be using. This normally will need no change.

This is basically everything you need to start using Sylpheed for POP3 mailsystems. You select "Message -> receive new mail" or press the <ref id="shortcut"> and see if there is new mail!
</sect1>
</sect>
<!-- added 2001/07/20 -->
<sect>Quick-guide for news setup<p>
<sect1>Getting news in a hurry.<p>
<p>
In the configuration menu, select "Create new account"
<p>
In the "Basic" tab, enter the relevant data. You name the account, enter your name and e-mail address, etc. To connect to news, in the Protocol box you select "News (NNTP)".




<p>
Enter the newsserver information.
<p>
Skip the "Receive" tab.
<p>
In the "Send" tab you can set up some more settings.
<p>
In the "Compose" tab you can define your signature file.




<p>
In the "Advanced" tab you can edit the portnumbers for the servers you will be using. This normally will need no change.
<p>
Close the dialogs, right click the new News folder in the folder pane and select "Subscribe to newsgroups". If not done already, a list of groups will be downloaded from the server. From there you will find your way, so good luck!

<sect1>Nuts and bolts of installation
<p>
<itemize>
<item>Download the latest version of the Sylpheed package from
<url url="http://sylpheed.good-day.net/" name="http://sylpheed.good-day.net/">
</item>
<item>Untar the sourcefiles to a new directory
<item>tar -xvfz sylpheed-.tar.gz (for tar.gz)
<item>tar -xvfI sylpheed-.tar.bz2 (for tar.bz2) 
<item>cd to the new sylpheed- directory 
<item>Run ./configure to check your environment and create the installation make files 
<item>Run the 'make' program which will compile the sources. Do not proceed with this step if there are fatal errors in the previous step. Fatal errors indicate that things are missing in order to compile Sylpheed properly. 
</itemize>
<p>
If the make process has completed, run "make install" (as root), to install the program and the supportfiles

<sect2>Compiling Sylpheed with options<label id="compile_sylpheed">
<p>
You can choose to compile Sylpheed with some optional features enabled.
Use <it>./configure --help</it> to list configuration syntax and options.
<p>
The following optional features can be enabled:

<itemize>
	<item>
		<it>Jpilot</it>: to use you PDA addressbook with Sylpheed. You will
		need the <it>Jpilot</it> library (and <it>pilot-link</it>, too).
		Enable this option with the <it>--enable-jpilot</it> configure switch.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>GnuPG</it>: Sylpheed can encrypt and sign your messages (also decrypt
		and verify the signatures of the incoming messages) using GnuPG.
		GnuPG follows the OpenPGP standard and is compatible with PGP.
		To enable this feature, you need to install GnuPG and GPGME (interface
		library to GnuPG).
		Enable this option with the <it>--enable-gpgme</it> configure switch.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>LDAP</it>: Sylpheed can connect to a LDAP server in order to
		query mail addresses. To enable this feature you will need the
		OpenLDAP library.
		Enable this option with the <it>--enable-ldap</it> configure switch.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>X-Faces</it>: you can create a small picture (of your face, or
		of anything else) that will be sent in the header of your mails.
		This option is enabled if the compface library is found and
		can be disabled using the <it>--disable-compface</it> configure switch.
	</item>
	<item>
		Images can appear "inline" (embedded in the message window, without
		the need of an external viewer) if Sylpheed is compiled
		with either the <it>gdk-pixbuf</it> or the <it>imlib</it> library.
		You can choose the library (if both are installed) by using the
		<it>--disable-gdk-pixbuf</it> or <it>--disable-imlib</it> configure switch.
	</item>
</itemize>

All these features require additional libraries and tools that may not be part
of your distribution. You can find them at the addresses listed at the beginning
of this chapter, <ref id="option_libraries" name="here">.

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1>Installation on Linux using RPM
<p>
As root, run the "rpm -ivh " command on the RPM file you downloaded. As soon as this process is complete you can run Sylpheed as user. 
</sect1>

<sect1>Installation on Debian Linux
<p>
With an internet connection :
<p>
apt-get install sylpheed (to install it with a internet connection)
<p>
Without internet connection, fetch the debian package for example on
<url url="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/sylpheed.html" name="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/sylpheed.html">
<p>
dpkg -i sylpheedx.x.x-1i386.deb
<p>
dpkg --install sylpheedx.x.x-1i386.deb
</sect1>

<sect1>Installation on FreeBSD
<p>
using the /stand/sysinstall tool (it is a menu-based interface) :
<p>
run "/stand/sysinstall" as root
<p>
in the main menu choose "Configure" -> "Packages" -> "mail", then "sylpheed" then, back to the "Packages" list, choose "Install"
<p>
Using the ports
<p>
Get the sylpheed port on :
<p>
<url url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4.3-release/mail" name="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4.3-release/mail">
<p>
then, as root: pkg-add sylpheed-0.x.x.tgz
<p>
using the ports with compiling:
<p>
first, update your port, fetch it on 
<url url="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/mail.html" name ="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/mail.html">
<p>
cd /usr/ports/mail/sylpheed
<p>
make
<p>
If it succeeds, type "make install"
<p>
In case it fails, fetch the required package if necessary
(on the same page), put the package file in /usr/ports/distfiles/
then :
<itemize>
<item>cd /usr/ports/mail/sylpheed
<item>make
<item>make install
</itemize>
<p>
Need a more up-to-date version ?
<p>
Just use the Unix standard method (see "Nuts and bolts of installation")
</sect1>

</sect>

<sect>Starting and quitting Sylpheed

<sect1>Starting Sylpheed
<p>
Starting Sylpheed can be done by typing "sylpheed" on a prompt in a terminal and pressing Enter. You can also add Sylpheed to a menu in KDE or Gnome, or create a shortcut to it on the desktop, if your window manager allows that.
<p>
When you first start Sylpheed, the program will ask you where you want to store the mails that you downloaded. You can accept the default ($HOME/Mail) or set up your own mail folder.
<p>
Sylpheed will then load with it's default settings. The way to change these are written about further on in this manual.
</sect1>

<sect1>Quitting Sylpheed
<p>
Ending Sylpheed can be done in several ways:
<itemize>
<item>Select "quit" from the File menu
<item>Press Ctrl-Q
<item>Click the "program close" button in the titlebar.
</itemize>
</sect1>

</sect1>

<sect1>Configuration menu
<p>
In the Configuration menu, clearly, you can set up Sylpheed 
the way you want it to work and react.

<itemize>
	<item>
		<it>Common preferences:</it> in this option you will be 
		presented a dialog in which you can select a number 
		of tabs. Each tab represents a specific set of settings 
		in Sylpheed. In the next chapter, these dialog options 
		are explained in more detail.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Filter setting:</it> this option shows you a dialog in which you 
		can set up the filtering rules that you want Sylpheed 
		to process on receiving new e-mails. You first specify 
		on which part(s) of the e-mail Sylpheed has to check, 
		and then you tell Sylpheed what to do. You can move the 
		message to a different directory (including trash to get 
		rid of spam mail). Selecting the destination folder is 
		possible through a browser window that comes up when you 
		press "Select..."
		<p>
		You can choose not to receive the e-mail. Note that 
		this will leave the message on the mailserver of your 
		provider, the message will not be removed!
		<p>
		When you press the "Register" button, the filter 
		rule is added to the list of rules. Do you select 
		"Substitute", then the selected rule is replaced by the 
		information of the setting entered. "Delete" in the end 
		will delete the selected filtering rule.
		<p>
		Please note that you can set up two selections for a rule, 
		which can be "OR'd" or "AND'd". OR means that one of the 
		two selections will have to match for the rule to be 
		executed. AND means that both selections have to match 
		before an action is performed.
		<p>
		To the right of the selection rules you see buttons 
		called UP and DOWN. You can move rules up and down in 
		the list. This will often trigger different behaviour 
		in the selections, so consider the order in which 
		you set the rules.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Template:</it> let your create a new message template.
		When composing a new message you can then used one
		of the defined templates and insert it (or use it to
		completely replace the content of your mail).
		The templates can contain some special characters
		that are replaced when the template is used in order
		to create a dynamic text. Use the symbols button on
		the templates definition window to see the list of
		the available symbols.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Actions:</it> let your create new commands to be added to the
		'Tools/Actions' menu. An action is a command that processes
		the select part of a message, the message body or the complete
		message file. It can be a background process, used as a filter
		(reads, modifies and replaces a message),...
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Preferences for current account:</it> here you can set the 
		specifics for the account you are currently using. 
		Should mail be deleted after fetching, what is the 
		server it comes from, etc. Basically it is the same 
		dialog form as shown in setting up a new account.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Create new account:</it> here you name the account (each 
		account has a recognizable name), you set up your name 
		and e-mail address etc. You set up the type of server 
		you access (POP4, IMAP4, local mailbox, newsserver) 
		and where the downloaded messages have to go (default 
		folder is the inbox). In the RECEIVE tab you select or 
		unselect options, in SEND you can set up how to send 
		your messages. In COMPOSE you can point to a specific 
		signature file, and in ADVANCED you can set up alternate 
		ports for the server, if these exist. (Do not mess 
		with these unless you are sure you have to!!)
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Edit accounts:</it> here you can select one of the accounts 
		you created, from a list, and edit the information about 
		them. Note that you cannot edit an account for which 
		you are writing a message at the same time. This to 
		ensure data integrity.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Change current account:</it> here you can select what 
		account you want to use, to write a message.
		If you have enabled the status bar (in the view menu),
		the name of the current account is shown in the bottom
		right corner of the Sylpheed window (in the status bar)
		and can be changed by a click on it (then a menu appears
		and lists all your accounts).
	</item>
</itemize>

</sect1>

<sect1>Help menu
<p>
This menu lets you look at the manual and FAQ of Sylpheed, 
and you can also see the "about" info, who wrote Sylpheed.
<p>

</sect1>

<sect1>Context menu
<p>
You can pull up context menus (through clicking button2) for 
the folder tree and the summary pane. (windows users: button2 
is the right mouse button.)
<p>
In the folder view you can add, rename and remove folders 
through the context menu. You can also set the folder
properties (define the selected folder as an inbox, outbox,
trash, ...).
<p>
In the message summary you can do a host of things from the 
context menu, like viewing message headers, opening a message 
in a separate window (also possible by double clicking on a 
message) etc...

</sect1>
<sect>Dialogs and views<p>




<p>
The appearance of the Sylpheed windows is controlled by
a Gtk+ theme (as Sylpheed is based on the Gtk+ toolkit).
Read the Gtk+ or your distribution documentation to find
how to change the Gtk+ theme.

<sect1>Folder view
<p>
The folder view shows you all the mail folders that you have created, 
in a tree-like structure. If you want to see the headers of the messages 
in a specific folder, just click the name of the folder once, and in the 
summary view (2)  you can see the messages in the selected mail folder.
<p>
When you see a + sign in front of a folder name, that means the folder 
branch of that part of the tree is 'collapsed'. You can expand that 
part by clicking the + sign. In that same manner you can also collapse 
the - sign in front of an expanded branch of the folder tree.
<p>
The folder pane can be resized be dragging (left mouse button down)
the handle found on the left of the folder view.
<p>
The folder window can be detached from the main Sylpheed window
by selecting the menu action: <tt>View -> Separate folder tree</tt>.
When exiting the current state of the folder window (attached or 
detached) is saved to be restored when re-starting Sylpheed.
To re-attach the folder window, de-select the menu entry.
<p>
<sect2>Special folders:
<p>
<it>Draft:</it> here you store messages that you want to send out more often, 
or you want to work on some more. Using the 'reedit' option from the 
message menu, you can edit the message further.
<p>
<it>Trash:</it> in here all your deleted messages go. Depending on the common 
preferences setting, this box is or is not emptied when you end Sylpheed.
<p>
<it>Sent:</it> in here are saved the messages you send (enabled by a
common preference setting and the folder can be changed by an account
preference setting).
<p>
<it>Queue:</it> this folder contains the composed messaged waiting to
be sent (with Sylpheed message sending can be delayed).

</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1>Summary view
<p>
The summary pane can show you many things. You can select what you 
want to see from the Summary menu, selecting the option 
"Set display item". A list of all options is:
<itemize>
<item>Mark: shows if the message is marked.
<item>Unread: shows if the message is read or not
<item>MIME: shows MIME attachments
<item>Number: shows the MH number of the message
<item>Size: the size of the entire message including attachments
<item>Date: the date of sending by the sender
<item>From: who sent the message
<item>Subject: what the message is about
</itemize>

You can sort the summary view in many ways, by clicking the button 
that is above the column. Click once to sort going up (a-z), click 
once more to sort going down (z-a).
<p>
If you think the size of a column is not right, you can adjust that 
by placing the mouse cursor next to the button of the column you 
want to adjust, press mousebutton1 (left button) and drag the 
column to the width you want it to have.
<p>
Select a message by clicking on it with the mouse. Once the summary 
pane has the focus of the program, you can also move up and down 
in the list through the cursor keys, or pressing "p"(revious) and 
"n"(ext) as in Pine.
</sect1>

<sect1>Message view
<p>
In the message view you can read the message that you selected in 
the summary pane. If you entered the summary pane without selecting 
a message, the message view will be empty. At the top of the 
message view some info is presented about the message you are 
reading, as well as some statistics on the selected folder.
<p>
You can scroll up and down in the message by using the arrow keys 
(after clicking inside the message), or by using the scrollbar.
<p>
The size of the message and summary views can be adjusted by dragging
(with the left mouse button down) the handle that appears between
the two panes.
<p>
The small arrow located just below the summary pane scrollbar can
be used to detach the message view. When clicked, the summary view
is extended down to the bottom of the Sylpheed window, and the messages
are displayed is a separate window (when you double click them in the
summary pane). This state is not saved on exit, and the message window
can be restored below the summary one by clicking again the small arrow.
<p>
When the current message contains attachments, two tabs
are displayed in the message window. Selecting the first one makes
the message window display the text body of the message, while selecting
the second tab makes the message window display the attachment part
of the message. In the latter case, the message window is splitted
in two parts, the top one contains the attachments as a tree
with the MIME type, size and file name of each part, while the bottom
part contains the content of the selected attachment (if the attachment
is an image and Sylpheed has been compiled with the gdk-pixbuf or
the imlib library).
</sect1>

</sect>
<sect>Sylpheed configuration
<p>
All the configuration settings of Sylpheed are accessible from
the <it>Configuration</it> menu and consist of common settings
(<it>Common preferences</it>, <it>Filter settings</it>, 
<it>Template</it> and <it>actions</it>) and account specific
settings.
<p>
With Sylpheed, there is no limit to the number of accounts
you can create. You can create new accounts for each of your
mail account, but also to change the default behaviour of 
Sylpheed. As folders can be attached to accounts, the account
specific part of the configuration automatically change based
on the current folder (you can have a different signature when
replying to messages from different folders).

<sect1>Common preferences
<p>
The Common Preferences, found in the Configuration menu, controls
the window layout and the different options of the graphical
interface of Sylpheed. Depending on some compile time switches
(and on the availability of some extra libraries), some tabs
may be included (or not) in your version of Sylpheed. These tabs
are not listed here but are described (or will be described) in
the sections covering the optional features they control (like the
<it>Privacy</it> tab for the GnuPG interface).

<sect2>Receive tab
<p>
In here you can set up how to receive messages.




<itemize>
	<item>
		You can define a special program to pick up messages from 
		the default unix mailbox. Usually this is not used, but 
		you can use it. Actually, this information may be wrong. 
		If someone knows better, please let me know.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Local spool</it> lets you define where your local mailbox is 
		located. You can also tell Sylpheed whether or not to 
		filter the incoming messages from that mail spool file.
		The spool directory defined here is used by all the accounts
		of the <it>local</it> type, by default it is set to the
		standard UNIX mailbox location.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Autocheck new mail</it>. When you check this option, Sylpheed 
		will check if there is new mail on the set interval.
	</item>

<sect2>Send tab
<p>
In here you can set up how to send messages.




<itemize>
	<item>
		You can choose to use an external program (like sendmail) for
		sending mail. By default no external program is necessary
		and Sylpheed can directly send the outgoing messages to a
		SMTP server.
	</item>
	<item>
		The sent messages can be saved in the outbox (<it>Sent</it> 
		folder), the name of the outbox folder can be specified
		for each account (see the account setting section).
	</item>
	<item>
		The outgoing codeset selection can be changed to force
		the definition of the character set used in sent mails.
		The default and recommended value is <it>automatic</it>,
		so Sylpheed determines the codeset when sending each
		message.
	</item>
</itemize>

		it automatically (unless your signature file already contains
		this separator). Leave it as it is by default (unless you really
		need to change it, and are ready to face a religion war), a lot
		of mail clients rely on this separator to cut the signature when
		quoting mails, and this one is accepted as the standard one.

		If you hate the editor that comes with Sylpheed, you can choose
		to automatically start an editor of your choice when composing
		new messages (the editor can be defined in the <it>Other</it> tab).
	</item>
	<item>
		The <it>wrap</it> settings defines how Sylpheed will wrap long
		lines. You can choose to wrap quoted messages, wrap as you type,
		or wrap when sending. You can also change the maximum line length.
	</item>
	<item>
		The <it>reply</it> settings let you control the way you will reply
		to mails. If <it>Automatically select account(...)</it> is set,
		the account used when replying to a message is automatically
		selected based on the folder the original message is in (as you
		where already told, accounts can be attached to folders).
		If <it>Quote message when replying</it> is selected, when hiting
		the <it>Reply</it> button, the composition window pops up and is
		filled with either the complete message you are replying to (if
		nothing is selected in the body of this message) or the selected
		part of its body. When this option is not selected, the composition
		window is always empty, and you must cut-and-paste the parts of
		the original message you want to quote manually.

<sect2>Quote tab
<p>
In here you can control the quotation of your replies and forwarded
messages.




<itemize>
	<item>
		You can individually define the quotation mark that appears
		at the beginning of each quoted line when replying and forwarding
		a message.
	</item>
	<item>
		You can also define the text that appears before and after the

	<item>
		Turning on the translation of the header fields will change the
		content of the header summary (between the summary and the message
		pane), and use the localized header fields name based on the
		selected language (selected by the 'LANG' environment variable).
		This setting will only take effect the next time you will start
		Sylpheed.
	</item>
	<item>
		Selecting <it>Display unread next to folder name</it> will add
		the number of unread messages next to the folder name in the
		folder pane (so you can minimize the width of the folder pane
		and hide the unread column).
	</item>
	<item>
		You can also control the content of the summary pane. If you choose
		to display the recipient name for the mail you send, in the <it>From</it>
		column, for any mail you have sent, the name of the recipient will
		appear preceded by an arrow (the characters sequence: -->).
		The <it>Expand threads</it> controls the initial state of the message
		threads when opening a folder (expanded of collapsed).
		The <it>Set display item of summary</it> button opens a selection
		window that contains all the available items to display in the
		left column, the currently selected items in the right column.
		Items can be added or removed using the two arrows that appears
		between the columns. Using the <it>up</it> and <it>down</it> buttons
		on the right side of the window, you can change the display order
		of the selected item in the summary window (from left to right).

		in the message view. If the message coloration has been turned on,
		the addresses that appear in the header part of the message view
		are highlighted as URIs.
	</item>
	<item>
		The <it>Line space</it> setting controls the lines spacing of the
		message view.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Leave space on head</it>. Checking this box will make the 
		start of new lines (unwrapped, where the writer has pressed 
		the Enter/Return key) indent a few pixels. This can be useful 
		to read larger e-mails.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Scroll half page</it>. When enabled, the text in the message 
		view will only scroll half a page instead of a whole page when 
		pressing the space bar.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Smooth scroll</it>. Enabling this box will make the text 
		in the message view scroll in a smooth, sliding way. For the 
		eye this can be pleasing, it is a personal preference.
	</item>
	<item>
		Select the <it>Resize attached image</it> if you wnat all the

<sect2>Interface tab
<p>
The interface tab controls the Sylpheed's Graphical User Interface
behaviour.




<itemize>
	<item>
		The <it>Open message when cursor keys are pressed</it> toggles controls
		the opening of the messages while you go through them in the summary
		pane using the cursor (up and down arrows) keys. If this toggle is on,
		each time you press the <it>down</it> (or <it>up</it>) key in the the
		summary window, the current message changes and the content of the
		message view changes to the content of the newly selected message.
		Otherwise, the content of the message view does not change unless you
		press enter (then the message view contains the content of the selected
		message).
		This does not change the behaviour of the left mouse button (always selects
		and open the pointed message).
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Open first unread message when entering a folder</it> if selected,
		when opening a folder, the message view will contain the first unread
		message of this folder (or the latest message in the order the folder
		uses for sorting messages). If not selected, the message view remains
		empty until a message is selected (by changing the current message with
		the cursor keys or with the left mouse button).
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Only marks message  read when open in new window</it> leaves the
		selected message unread (but display it in the message view) until you
		open it in a new window (double click the left mouse button).
	</item>
	<item>
		If <it>Execute immediately when moving or deleting messages</it> is not
		selected, a new button appears in the button bar marked <it>Execute</it>.
		When deleting or moving messages, they are first marked as deleted or
		moved but Sylpheed does not move or delete them until you press the 
		<it>Execute</it> button (or the <it>Execute</it> entry of the 
		<it>Tools</it> menu).
	</item>
	<item>
		The <it>Receive dialog</it> settings controls the dialog that pops
		up (if you have set <it>Show receive dialog</it> to <it>always</it>)
		when receiving new mails.
		The default is to open a pop up window upon reception error unless
		you select the <it>Dont't pop up error dialog (...)</it> toggle.
	</item>
	<item>
		 <it>The Set key bindings</it> button when pressed, opens a selection
		 window that contains a list of pre-defined key bindings (<it>Mew</it>,

</sect2>

<sect2>Other tab
<p>
The other tab contains the settings that does not fit the
previous categories.




<itemize>
	<item>
		<it>Web browser</it>. Here you can enter the name of your favorite 
		web browser (Netscape, Opera, Mozilla, Lynx etc.). Add the %s parameter 
		to the command so Sylpheed knows it has to provide the text you clicked 
		on as the URL that the browser has to visit.
		The arrow next to the text field can be used to display a scrolling
		list of predefined URL browsing command lines.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Printing</it>. Here you can define the program that should be used 
		to print. Default is lpr, and the %s is the name of the temporary file 
		that Sylpheed creates for lpr to print.
		When using the <it>File->Print</it> menu entry to print the selected
		message, a text window pops up to allow you to change the command
		used to print.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>External editor</it>. You can select an external editor to write 
		your e-mails with, for example vi, emacs or gedit. Note that for 
		text-based editors like vi, you need to define a terminal window, 
		e.g. <tt>xterm -e vi %s</tt>. Otherwise there is no place that the 
		editor will be able to show up. Here too, the %s parameter is the 
		name of a temporary file that is created by Sylpheed.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Add address to destination (...)</it> when selected,

<sect1>Setting up an account/changing an account
<p>
In order to set up an account in Sylpheed, in the <it>Configuration</it>
menu you select <it>Create new account</it>. If you want to change the 
settings of an existing account and this account is the current
one, in the <it>Configuration</it> menu select <it>Preferences for 
current account</it>, otherwise select <it>Edit accounts...</it>.
There you select the account you want to change. After that you press 
<it>edit</it>. Then a dialog appears in which you can enter or update 
the following areas:
<p>

<sect2>Basic tab<label id="Basic">
<p>




In the "Basic" tab you name the account. This is to make identifying 
the account easier. The name is then used in the <it>Change current account</it>
part of the <it>Configuration</it> menu, or in menu found in the lower 
right corner of the main window (used to quickly switch to another account).
<p>
Choose a name that tells something about the account, like the 
name of the ISP, mailbox or news-server you are setting up.  
You can select this account to be the default account ("Usually used").
The default account can also be defined from the <it>Edit accounts</it>
window (toggle the <it>D</it> column next to the account name).
<p>
Enter your name and e-mail address, and if you have one, the 
organization that you use Sylpheed for.
In the Protocol box you select the type of service that this 
account will be using. The flavors you can choose are: <it>POP3 normal</it>, 
<it>POP3 APOP auth</it>, <it>IMAP4</it>, <it>NNTP news</it> or <it>None (local)</it>.
<p>
For POP3 and IMAP services you can then specify the server where 
your mail is stored. Details about this name, and also the name 
that goes into the field for <it>SMTP server (send)</it> should be given 
to you by your ISP.
<p>
For a local unix mailbox, the <it>Server for receiving</it> is disabled, 
since the mail will be received for you.
<p>
The fields for <it>User ID</it> and <it>Password</it> will also be
disabled for accounts that do no deal with POP3 or IMAP services.
Otherwise you can enter the login name and password for the e-mail
server with your ISP here. Usually these are the same as your login 
name and password to access the dial-in service, but this is 
not standard. If in doubt, contact the helpdesk of your ISP.

<sect3>Passwords:
<p>
The password is not printed in the entry field (replaced by stars) but
is stored in plaintext in the Sylpheed configuration files. The Sylpheed
configuration directory (~/.sylpheed) is only readable by 'owner', and
not by 'group' and 'other', do not change these access rights.
</sect3>

</sect2>

<sect2>Receive tab<label id="Receive">
<p>




The <it>Receive</it> tab is only used for POP3 accounts. Here you
specify if the mails that were successfully retrieved should be removed 
from the server. You can also tell Sylpheed to get all the 
messages there, not only the ones you already received (in case 
you leave your messages on the server).
You can choose to leave the messages on the server during a selectable
number of days (then remove them).
<p>
You can also define a limit for the size of the messages to
download. Any message bigger than this limit will not be
downloaded.
<p>
You can also choose to filter messages on receiving, if not
set, the messages are only filtered when you use the filter
entry of the Tools menu.
<p>
The default inbox defines the folder that receives the incoming
(and not filtered) messages for this account.
You can define a different folder as inbox for each of your
accounts.
<p>
If the <it>Get all checks for messages on this account</it> is turned
off, when using the <it>Get all</it> menu entry (or toolbar button)
this account will not be checked. To check for new mails for
this account, you must select the account, then use the <it>Get</it>
toolbar button (or menu entry).
</sect2>

<sect2>Send tab<label id="Send">
<p>




In the <it>Send</it> tab you can define the settings that apply 
to sending mails.
<p>
You can choose to add the date field to the messages you send,
generate a unique message identifier, or add custom header
fields.

<sect3>X-face pictures:
<p>
The user defined header field should be set up to contain your
X-face picture.
Thanks to Jeff Dairiki, you can have a complete online course in this. 
Visit <url url="http://www.dairiki.org/xface/" name="this page"> for the details.
</sect3>

<p>
If your SMTP server needs authentication, define the user ID and
password to use in this tab. You can also choose to first authenticate with
POP3 before sending.

</sect2>

<sect2>Compose tab<label id="Compose"><p>




In the <it>Compose</it> tab you can define your signature file, 
choose to always copy someone when sending mails (you can
choose to always copy your boss, or yourself), and define the
Reply-To field for the current account.
</sect2>

<sect2>Privacy tab<label id="Privacy">
<p>
This tab is only available when Sylpheed has been compiled
with GPGME and GNUPG (for signature and encryption).

<p>
With this tab you can choose the keys to use when signing
or encrypting mails for this account.
</sect2>

<sect2>Advanced tab<label id="Advanced">

<p>
The Advanced tab contains some settings you normally do
not need to change (unless you really know what you are
doing).




<p>
You can change the default SMTP or POP3 ports used when
connecting to your mail server, define a domain name to
use when sending a mail. Some ISP (or mail relays) reject
mails without a valid domain name.
<p>
The default folders for the sent messages, drafts and
trash can be defined here. If not changed the current account
will use the default folders.
</sect2>

<sect2>Attaching accounts to folders
<p>
Pressing the right mouse button over a folder (in the folder pane), 
and selecting the <it>Properties</it> entry will open the folder properties
form. In this form, in the <it>General</it> tab you can see (but not modify)
the folder name and the corresponding directory path (relative to the mail
directory). In the <it>Compose</it> tab:




you can select the account, choose to apply this setting also to
the sub-folders.
You can also force the address used when sending mail (to force a mailing
list address, for example), choose to send a copy of the sent mails
to a list of addresses different from the default one defined for the
selected account.
</sect2>

<sect2>Using accounts in the real life
<p>
Accounts can, of course be used to retrieve mails from different ISPs,
separate your personal and professional messages, but also to make your
life easier.
You can define different accounts just to change your address (as sender),
your signature, change the sent folder, etc...
Here is a summary of the account specific settings, feel free to
find your own use for them:

<itemize>
	<item>
		Sender name, address and organization. Signature, extra header
		fields.
	</item>
	<item>
		Leave or remove message from server (usefull for debug).
	</item>
	<item>
		Incoming mails filtering and size limit.
	</item>
	<item>
		Default field (<it>Reply-To</it>:, <it>Cc:</it>, <it>Bcc:</it>).
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Draft</it>, <it>Trash</it> and <it>Sent</it> folders.
	</item>
</itemize>

By attaching accounts to folders, you can control all these settings
on a folder basis, but you can also change the <it>To:</it>, <it>Cc:</it>, 
<it>Bcc:</it>, and <it>Reply-To:</it> for each folder (overrides the account
settings).

<sect>Viewing messages
<sect1>Reading a message<p>
Reading a message is quite simple. If you have the message pane within view, all you need to do is once click the message you want to read and it already appears in the message view. When you double-click the message, a separate window will open, showing you the message. You can close the opened window by pressing ESCape or clicking the 'close' button.
</sect1>
<sect1>Viewing Multipart MIME (Attached Files)<p>
When a message contains an attachment, you can have several options to view the information in that file. Sylpheed can be able, when compiled against the proper libraries, to display images "inline". This means you can click the name of the image and you can see it in the lower part of the message screen.<p>
How do you see an attachment is in an e- mail?<p>
This shows through an extra section that appears between the summary pane and the message view. In it you can see the separate parts of the e-mail. Sometimes you can't view the contents of an attachment directly. Then you can rightclick the name of the file and select "OPEN" from the appearing menu. If this does not work, it means that the extension of the file is not recognized through the directives in the mailcap file. In that case you can always use the "Save as..." option in the popup menu, save the file to disk and open the file with the proper program.
</sect1>
<sect1>Extending and Closing Threads
<p>
Sylpheed offers the option to view messages in threads. Threads are no more than series of e-mails in a logical sequence. Suppose 15 people sent you a mail called "Re: bananas". You can't easily tell which one is the first and which one is the last in that sequence.<p>
By activating threads (summary menu), Sylpheed will attempt to show the sequence of mails as they were written/sent from first to last.<p>
To undo the threads view, you simply select the same menu option again and the e-mails are displayed in standard order again.
</sect1>
<sect1>Message Operations (Moving, Deleting, etc.)
<p>
Sylpheed gives you many ways to manage your messages. You can move them to new mailboxes, or delete them. Through the message menu (see that section for more details) plenty of options are available to do with your e-mails what you want done. The advantage of moving messages to different mailboxes (also see Filtering for that, as described in the Configuration menu section) is that you keep an overview of your inbox. Suppose you are collecting e-mails in there of 8 different subjects. And you are looking for a specific one on a specific subject. That will give you a lot of work, trying to find the right message. Creating a new mail folder for each subject, and moving the messages to that new one, lifts a lot of work afterwards from your hands.
</sect1>
<sect1>URL in a Message
<p>
At times you may find a URL in a message. A URL is a link to a website. Usually it is shown in the form "http://www.somewhere.something".<p>
If you want to visit that website, you only need to double-click the URL, and the default webbrowser you set up (usually Netscape) will activate and load the website.<p>
In the configuration options, Sylpheed has a color setting specific for URL's so you can spot a URL easily.

<sect>Recieving Messages

<sect1>Using POP Reception Function in Sylpheed<p>
<!-- added 2001/07/19 -->
Receiving messages from a POP server is very easy, once you set up Sylpheed the proper way. You can refer to the section "Setting up an account" on how to do this.<p>
Once you are connected to the internet, or by another network that gives you access to the POP server, simply press the "Get new mail" button (or press Alt-I) and Sylpheed will connect to the server to fetch your new mail. Once this is retrieved, any filters you may have set up will be executed and then the folder pane will show you, marked in bold, which folder/mailbox contains new messages.
<!-- end addition 2001/07/19 -->
</sect1>
<sect1>Using Other Programs such as fetchmail<p>
<!-- added 2001/07/19 -->
Although it is not within the scope of this manual, a bit of information on fetchmail or getmail.<p>
You need to have either of these programs installed, and configured correctly. See the man pages/README files of the appropriate program on doing this.<p>
After setting the program up, you can invoke it, either by hand or through CRON, to get your mail. The mail will usually be downloaded into /var/spool/mail/your_user_id. You can then tell Sylpheed, through an account that looks in your local unix mailbox, to get mail from there. For this you press the "Get mail" button, or press "Alt-I".
<!-- end addition 2001/07/19 -->
</sect1>

</sect>

<sect>Composing Messages

<sect1>Composing a New Message<p>
When you start writing a new message, you are presented a nice dialog in which you can enter all kinds of information. In the From: line you find a dropdown list. In there you can select the e-mail account you want to use as the sending account.<p>
In the To: / Cc: / Bcc: part, you write the e-mail address of the receiver. You can enter several e-mail addresses, as long as they are separated by commas. An important utility here is the button "Address". When you click that, you see the address book. You can point at an address, click the "To:", "Cc:" or "Bcc:" button, and Sylpheed will place the address in the selected line. The Bcc: may be greyed out. In order to make that accessible, you need to add the Bcc: line to the message. You do that through the Message menu, and checking the Bcc option.<p>
In the Subject line you enter a short descriptive text what your message will be about.<p>
You can move between these lines by pressing TAB (to skip to the next line) and SHIFT-TAB (to go back up). When you press TAB in the last line, you will be moved to the message body.<p>
Did you select a signature file in the settings for the active account, it will be in the message text already. You can now write your message. When you are done, you can click Send, Send later or Draft in the toolbar. Send attempts to send the message immediately. Send later will place it in the Send folder, and Draft will place it in the Draft folder.
</sect1>
<sect1>Replying to a Message<p>
<!-- added 2001/07/19 -->
To reply to a message, you use the "reply" function. In Sylpheed you activate this through either the "Reply" button, or by pressing Alt-R.<p>
A new message window will be created, with the e-mail address of the recipient and the subject already set for you. Most of the things described in Composing a new message are also applicable to this window.
<!-- end add 2001/07/19 -->
</sect1>
<sect1>Replying to a Message with Quotation<p>
<!-- added 2001/07/19 -->
If you want to have Sylpheed quote the text you are replying to, you need to go into the Configuration menu. There you select Common preferences, go to the Compose tab, and check the "Quote message when replying" box. There you can also edit the quotation mark (the mark put in front of each quoted line in the reply mail) and the reply attribution (which is placed in front of the reply text).
<!-- end add 2001/07/19 -->
</sect1>
<sect1>Forwarding Messages<p>
<!-- added 2001/07/19 -->
Forwarding a message means: you send the entire message, including headers (Sender address, date sent etc.) on to someone else. For this you press the "Forward" button, or you press Ctrl-F. A new message window is created, containing the text of the selected message. You can then supply the name(s) of the recipient(s) of the message as in composing a new message, perhaps add a few lines of text to the message and send it on its way.
<!-- end add 2001/07/19 -->
</sect1>
</sect>

<sect>Address Book
<p>




<p>
In the address book, accessible through Shift-Ctrl-A, 
the Addressbook button, or through the "Tools" menu, you 
store e-mail addresses of the people and places you want 
to write more often.
<p>
If the options have been compiled into Sylpheed, the
address book can connect to a LDAP server for address
lookup, and you can use the address book stored on your
Palm PDA.

<sect1>Adding and Deleting Addresses

<p>
Adding an address to the address book is quite easy too. 
Rightclick the folder or group you want to add the address 
to, select "new address" and fill in the dialog that comes 
up. You can also directly click the Add button in the 
address book window, and the dialog comes up. In this 
case the address is moved into the folder/group that is 
selected at the moment of adding.

<p>


<p>
In the "Basic data" tab, you can fill the first
and last name and provide a nickname. The "Display name"
will be used by the "Name" column of the address book
window.

<p>
<p>


<p>
In the "E-Mail address" tab, fill the address field
and use the "Add" button to add the address to the list.
An alias can also be assigned to this address and used
when searching for an address.
Several addresses can be assigned to the same person
in your address book by repeating the sequence described
above. The addresses can then be sorted by using the 
"Move up" and "Move down" buttons. The address on the top
will be the first one listed in the address book main window.

<p>
Deleting an address is equally simple. Find the address, 
click it once, and press the Delete button.

</sect1>

<sect1>Folders and Groups
<p>
You can use groups and folders to organize your address
book into categories, hierarchies and aliases.
The folders are used to generate a hierarchical organization
and contain the actual addresses, while the groups are
used to group together addresses that lives in separate
folders.
<p>
Sounds complicated, so let's see an example: consider
your workmates, they are arnaud (arnaud@company.com),
sandra (sandra@company.com), xavier (xavier@company.com)
and the chief, helene (helene@company.com). You can
create a folder named <tt>myGroup</tt>, create the entries
for all your workmates in this folder. Now you can create one
groupe named <tt>jokes</tt> that includes all but the boss
to use when sending your daily jokes, another one named
<tt>team</tt> that includes everybody for the usual group
(serious) communication, and a third group named
<tt>reports</tt> that includes the boss, and the one working 
with you on some projects for the weekly reports.
<p>
To generate this kind of addresses organization
you only need to create the entries once, then when
creating groups you can select among the existing entries
to fill the groups.
<p>
The address book, like the mail folders, can be expanded 
into an entire tree of sections. For this you right-click 
on the folder where you want to add a new folder, and 
select "new folder". Then you can enter a descriptive 
name for the folder, click Ok, and your folder is created.
<p>
In this same way you can create a new group in a folder. 
Right-click on the folder, select "new group", enter a name 
for it, and that's it.
<p>
The group settings window pops up in order to fill the group
with addresses. Use the two arrows to add to or remove from
the group the selected address.
Once the group contains the list of addresses you want it to
contain, click the "OK" button to close the window.

<sect1>Combination with Message Composition Window
<p>
You can either enter the first letters of an address
(or alias) in the <tt>To:</tt> or <tt>Cc:</tt> field
of the composition window and press the TAB key to
let Sylpheed do the completion or open the address book,
select addresses from there and use the <tt>To:</tt>
and <tt>Cc:</tt> buttons to copy the selected addresses
into the corresponding fields of the composition window.
<p>
When using the completion mode, when one or more address
matches the start you have entered, a dropdown list appears.
Select the correct address from this list and press enter
to complete the composition window's field.
<p>
In completion mode, the search is made on the E-mail
address and on the alias. The other fields of the
address book entry are not used (name, nickname,...).
<p>
When the address book is opened, if you select a group,
using the <tt>To:</tt> or <tt>Cc:</tt> buttons will
copy all the addresses of the selected group into the
corresponding field of the composition window.
<p>
Using our previous example, you can select the <tt>jokes</tt>
group when sending you morning jokes, and the <tt>reports</tt>
one when sending your weekly reports...

</sect1>

<sect1>Using your PDA addressbook (with Jpilot)
<p>
Sylpheed can optionally use your PDA addressbook. This option is
available if you have compiled Sylpheed with the support of Jpilot.
For more details regarding the compilation of Sylpheed with (or without)
optional features, see the 
<ref id="compile_sylpheed" name="compilation section">.

<p>
Sylpheed uses the Jpilot side copy of your address book, so you do
not need to put your PDA on the craddle to find an address (but do
not forget to synchronize).

<p>
In order to use your PDA's addressbook in Sylpheed, open the addressbook
window, select the <it>JPilot</it> icon in the left tree view,
use the <it>File -> New Jpilot</it> menu entry and choose a name for
this addressbook.
Define the name of the Jpilot addressbook file (usually in:
<tt>~/.jpilot/AddressDB.pdb</tt>) and press <it>OK</it>.
You can use one (or more) of the custom fields to store alternate
Email addresses for the same person.

<p>
Now you can browse your PDA addressbook. Sylpheed only has read
access to this addressbook, so you can't modify your PDA addressbook
from Sylpheed.

<sect>Filters, actions and templates
<p>
Sylpheed offers three powerfull tools to help you automatically
and efficently manage you mails. These tools are:

<itemize>
	<item>
		The <it>filters</it>, that let you sort you incoming messages and move
		them into your folders based on their sender, their content,
		using regular expressions.
	</item>
	<item>
		The <it>actions</it> feature is a convenient way for the user to launch 
		external commands to process a complete message file including 
		headers and body or just one of its parts.
		It allows also the use of an external command to filter the whole 
		text or just a selected part in the message window or in the 
		compose window.
	</item>
	<item>
		The <it>templates</it> that let you pre-define complete messages
		leaving placeholders in the text to be filled at composition time.
	</item>
</itemize>



<sect1>Filters
<p>
Written by Nick Selby (sylpheed@nickselby.com)
<p>
Sylpheed provides powerful filters to allow users to automatically 
pre-sort incoming mail based on a set of rules that the user defines. 
As a most simple example, let's say you work at the Acme Grommet Company, 
and you want all e-mail from your co-workers to be placed in one mailbox. 
To accomplish this, you would set up a filter that would place all mail 
whose "From" header includes the phrase "acmegrommet.com" into a specific 
mailbox.
<p>
Sylpheed allows you much more control than just that simple setup; 
you may create filters based on several variables, including an 
"If this AND that" or "If the message contains this OR does NOT contain that"
etc. It's very cool.

<sect2>Finding The Filter Setting Dialog
<p>
The filter settings dialog is located in the <it>Configuration</it> menu, 
under the title "Filter Setting" or from the <it>Tools</it> menu, under in
the <it>Create filter rules</it> sub menu. You may also use establish a 
keyboard shortcut (see Keyboard Shortcuts).




</sect2>
<sect2>Setting Up Filters<p>
Operator(s) and Processing instructions combine to create a Filter Rule.

* Operators
The dialog's first setting option establishes the Operator, the variable 
that will tell the filter what specific text to look for to trigger a 
filter. Each Filter Rule may have up to two operator sets.
<p>
Each Operator variable contains three sections: <it>Header</it>, 
<it>Keyword</it> and <it>Predicate</it>.
<p>
Header is a drop-down box which defines in which message header 
Sylpheed's filter will search. Choices range from <it>Subject</it> 
to <it>X-Mailer</it>. 

<it>Keyword</it> is a a text box in which you may enter the text 
for which the filter will search. 

Predicate allows you to choose to filter based on whether the operator 
contains, or does not contain, the text you enter in the Keyword field.
<p>
Example: Create an Operator in which the X-Mailer field of an incoming 
message contains the word 'Eudora'.

<itemize>
	<item>
		Step 1. Under the <it>Header</it> drop-down box, select 
		<it>X-Mailer</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 2. In the <it>Keyword</it> text box, type 'eudora' 
		(case insensitive)
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 3. Determine appropriate Predicate setting. Default 
		is <it>Contains</it>.
	</item>
</itemize>

The second Operator setting, which is set identically to the 
first, also allows the user to select an AND/OR setting 
declaring the relationship between the two operators. 
<p>
Example: Create an Operator set which will process mail with 
a <it>From</it> header of bob@acmegrommet.com AND a subject
of "2001 Spring Grommet Collection"

<itemize>
	<item>
		Step 1. Under the first Operator set's Header drop-down 
		box, select <it>From</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 2. In the <it>Keyword</it> text box, type 
		'bob@acmegrommet.com' (case insensitive).
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 3. Leave <it>Predicate</it> setting on default, 
		<it>Contains</it>
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 4. Leave <it>AND/OR</it> box on default setting, <it>and</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 5.	Under the second Operator set's <it>Header</it> 
		drop-down box, select <it>Subject</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 6. In the <it>Keyword</it> text box, type 
		'2001 spring grommet collection' (case insensitive).
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 7. Leave <it>Predicate</it> setting on default,
		<it>Contains</it>.
	</item>
</itemize>

</sect2>

<sect2>Message Processing
<p>
Once you've established the Operator(s) that will define 
which messages will be processed, it's time to tell 
Sylpheed what to do with messages that match the operator(s). 
You may choose between two radio button-selected settings: 
<it>Destination</it> and <it>Don't Receive</it>.
<p>
Selecting <it>Destinations</it> will enable you to route 
the mail into a mailbox which you specify.
<p>
Selecting <it>Don't Receive</it> will instruct Sylpheed 
to not download messages with that operator. Note that with 
<it>Don't Receive</it>, Sylpheed merely leaves the message 
on your mailserver - it does not delete it. 

To specify a mailbox to which you want the message transfered, 
click on the radio button to the left of the word <it>Destination</it>
in the dialog. (Currently, in order to specify a mailbox you 
must have created that mailbox prior to activating the Filter 
Setting dialog.) Clicking the <it>Select</it> button will open 
a pop-up window containing all mail folders currently active 
in your copy of Sylpheed. Select the mailbox you wish by either 

<itemize>
	<item>
		(a) double clicking on the mail folder name or 
	</item>
	<item>
		(b) clicking the mail folder name and then clicking <it>OK</it>.         
	</item>
</itemize>

<p>
To specify that the message not be retrieved, and left 
on your mail server, click the radio button to the left 
of the words <it>Don't Receive</it>.

</sect2>

<sect2>Filter Registration
<p>
Now that you have set the Operator and the Processing Rule, 
all that's left to do is tell Sylpheed to save the entire 
Filter Rule. <bf>If you skip this step, the filter won't work</bf>.
<p>
The <it>Register Rules</it> configuration has three options: 
<it>Register</it>, <it>Substitute</it> and <it>Delete</it>. 

<itemize>
	<item>
		<it>Register</it> saves the Filter Rule.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Substitute</it> modifies an existing registered 
		Filter Rule.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Delete</it> will remove a previously registered 
		Filter Rule. 
	</item>
</itemize>

Example of Registering A Filter Rule: Create a Filter Rule 
that moves all mail with the subject of "Sylpheed Manual" 
into the (previously created) mail folder "Sylpheed Manual Mail".

<itemize>
	<item>
		Step 1. Under the first Operator set's <it>Header</it> 
		drop-down box, select <it>Subject</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 2. In the <it>Keyword</it> text box, type 
		'sylpheed manual' (case insensitive).
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 3. Leave <it>Predicate</it> setting on default, 
		<it>Contains</it>. Leave second Operator set empty.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 4. Click <it>Destinations</it> radio button; 
		select "Sylpheed Manual Mail" folder.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 5. Click <it>Register</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 6. Click <it>OK</it>.
	</item>
</itemize> 

Example of Substituting A Filter Rule: Modify a previously 
created Filter Rule that moves all mail with the subject 
of "Sylpheed Manual" to sort mail not to the mail folder 
"Sylpheed Manual Mail" but rather the mail folder "Sylpheed Questions"  

<itemize>
	<item>
		Step 1. Under the first Operator set's <it>Header</it> 
		drop-down box, select <it>Subject</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 2. In the <it>Keyword</it> text box, type 
		'sylpheed manual' (case insensitive).
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 3. Leave <it>Predicate</it> setting on default, 
		<it>Contains</it>. Leave second Operator set empty.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 4. Click <it>Destinations</it> radio button; 
		select "Sylpheed Questions" folder.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 5. Click <it>Substitute</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 6. Click <it>OK</it>.
	</item>
</itemize>

Example of Deleting a Filter Rule: Remove the previously 
created Filter Rule which refers to Subject:Sylpheed Questions.

<itemize>
	<item>
		Step 1. In the <it>Registered Rules</it> select box, 
		highlight the filter entitled 
		"<it>Subject:Sylpheed Manual: :::Sylpheed Questions:1:1:m</it>"
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 2. Click the <it>Delete</it> Button.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 3. Confirm the deletion by clicking <it>Yes</it> in the 
		confirmation pop-up that asks, 
		<it>Do you really want to delete this rule?</it>
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 4. Click <it>OK</it>.
	</item>
</itemize>

</sect2>

<sect2>Registered Rule Order
<p>
One caveat about all this: the order in which Filter Rules 
are created could adversely affect your intended message sorting, 
and one needs to consider this when creating or updating Filter Rules. 
<p>
For example, a Filter Rule saying, "Move anything containing 'ABC' 
to Mailbox X" listed above another Filter Rule saying "Move anything 
containing 'ABCDEF' to Mailbox Y" will cause the latter of these 
filters not to process. 
<p>
Think about the way Sylpheed goes down its list: first, it would say..
"Hmm, any messages with ABC? Ah, there's one! Move it". 
Then it would think, "Okay, any messages with ABCDEF?" 
To which the answer would be "no" - that ABCDEF was already 
filtered because it contained "ABC".
<p>
Bummer.
<p>
In order to avoid this, you must ensure that the more complex 
Filter Rule is processed first, by placing it higher than a 
similar, conflicting Filter Rule. 
<p>
To move a Registered Rule higher or lower within the Registered 
Rule box, select the rule you would like to move, and click on 
the <it>Up</it> or <it>Down</it> buttons. This will "move" the 
rule up or down, above or below a potentially conflicting Filter Rule.   

</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1>How to Filter Messages
<p>
Filtering messages can be done in several ways:

<itemize>
	<item>
		Sylpheed automatically filters incoming mail from 
		POP servers.
	</item>
	<item>
		If you incorporate mail from a unix mailbox, then 
		in the <it>Common preferences</it> (<it>Configuration</it> menu), 
		you need to check the box called <it>Filter on incorporation</it>. 
		You find this box in the <it>Receive</it> tab in the space 
		<it>Local spool</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		You can also select the option <it>Filter messages</it> 
		from the Summary menu.
	</item>
</itemize>

Please note that, at time of writing, Sylpheed does -NOT YET- 
has filtering of IMAP messages enabled.

</sect1>

<sect1>Filtering mail with Procmail
<p>
If you feel that Sylpheed has not enough options to perform 
filtering for you, then you can look at Sylpheed Claws which 
has more options for filtering. You can find the Claws version 
(the cutting edge, experimental version of Sylpheed) 
sylpheed-claws.sourceforge.net.
<p>
Another option, if you do not want to work with an experimental 
version of Sylpheed, is Procmail. Procmail is a powerful mail 
filtering program that is triggered from the Mail Transport 
Agent (i.e. Sendmail, Postfix, Qmail). Procmail is called by 
default from these programs after receiving e-mail.
<p>
The trick to procmail is to tell it that mail has to be filtered 
into MH mail folders. This is not difficult though.
<p>
Normally procmail moves mail into MBOX format, this is one large 
file containing all mails in a folder. MH uses separate files 
for each e-mail. All you need to do is point the destination 
of a procmail rule to &lt;destination folder&gt;/.  
It is the "slash dot" that does the trick.


<sect1>Actions
<p>
The following section is a copy of 
<url url="http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/home/sylpheed/actions/index.html" name="Melvin's page">.

<p>
The "actions" feature is a convenient way for the user to 
launch external commands to process a complete message file 
including headers and body or just one of its parts. 
It allows also the use of an external command to filter the 
whole text or just a selected part in the message window or 
in the compose window. This is a generic tool that allows 
to do any uncommon actions on the messages, and thus extends 
the possibilities of Sylpheed. For example, Sylpheed does not 
include the rot13 cyphering algorithm popular in some 
newsgroups. It does not support natively armored encryption 
or clear signing. It does not support uuencoded messages. 
As all these features can be handled by external programs, 
the actions provide a convenient way to use them from the menu bar.

<sect2>Usage
<p>
To create a new action, go to the <it>Configuration</it> menu,
select the <it>Actions...</it> entry. The <it>Actions setting</it>
dialog offers to enter the Menu name that will trigger the command. 
The created menu will be found in the <it>Tools -> Actions</it> submenu. 
By inserting a slash / in the menu name, you create a submenu.

The command is entered in the Command line entry. Note that 
Sylpheed stores every single email in a separate file. This allows 
to use the following syntax for the command:

<itemize>
	<item>
		<it>%f</it> denotes the file name of the selected message. 
		If you selected more than one, then the command will be 
		launched for each message with the appropriate file name.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>%F</it> denotes the list of the file names of the 
		selected message. If only one message is selected, 
		this amounts to <it>%f</it>, but if more messages are 
		selected, then the command will be launched only once 
		with the list of the file names. (You can use both 
		<it>%f</it> and <it>%F</it> in one command: then the 
		command will be launched for each selected message 
		with the name of this message and with the list of 
		all selected messages. I did not find a practical 
		example for this.).
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>%p</it> denotes the current selected message part 
		of a multipart message. The part is decoded accordingly. 
		If the message is not a multipart message, it denotes 
		the message body.
	</item>
	<item>
		Prepending <it>&gt;</it>: this will allow you to send 
		to the command's standard input a text that you will 
		enter in a dialog window.
	</item>
	<item>
		Prepending <it>*</it>: this will allow you to send to 
		the command's standard input a text that you will enter 
		in a dialog window. But in contrast to prepending 
		<it>&gt;</it>, the entered text is hidden 
		(useful when entering passwords).
	</item>
	<item>
		Appending an ampersand <it>&amp;</it>: this will run 
		the command asynchronously. That means "fire and forget". 
		Sylpheed won't wait for the command to finish, nor will 
		it catch its output or its error messages.
	</item>
	<item>
		Prepending the vertical bar <it>|</it> (pipe-in): 
		this will send the current displayed text or the current 
		selected text from the message view or the compose 
		window to the command standard input. The command will 
		silently fail if more than one message is selected.
	</item>
	<item>
		Appending the vertical bar <it>|</it> (pipe-out): this 
		will replace the current displayed text or the current 
		selected text from the message window or the compose 
		window with the command standard output. The command 
		will silently fail if more than one message is selected.
	</item>
	<item>
		Appending the "greater than" sign <it>&gt;</it> will 
		insert the command output in the message. The difference 
		between the trailing <it>|</it> is that no text will be 
		deleted or replaced. Most used when composing mails to 
		insert text.
	</item>
</itemize>

<bf>Note</bf>: It is not possible to use actions containing 
<it>%f</it>, <it>%F</it> or <it>%p</it> from the compose window.
<p>
When a command is run, and unless it is run asynchronously, 
Sylpheed will be insensitive to any interaction and it will wait 
for the command to finish. If the command takes too long 
(5 seconds), it will popup a dialog window allowing to stop it. 
This dialog will also be displayed as soon as the command has 
some output: error messages or even its standard output when 
the command is not a "pipe-out" command. When multiple commands 
are being run, they are run in parallel and each command output 
is separated from the outputs of the others.
<p>
<sect3>Examples
<p>
Here are some examples that are listed in the same syntax 
as used for storing the actions list. You can copy and past 
the definition in your <it>~/.sylpheed/actionsrc</it> file 
(exit Sylpheed before). The syntax is very simple: one line 
per action, each action contains the menu name and the command 
line separated by a colon and a space ": ". 
Alternatively, you can use <it>Configuration -> Actions...</it> 
and for each example enter a menu name and copy&amp;paste the 
text after the colon and space ": " in the command definition.

an xterm is to be found 
<url url="http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/home/sylpheed/actions/gpg-sign-syl-xterm" name="here (gpg-sign-syl-xterm)">.

The uudec script is to be found 
<url url="http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/home/sylpheed/actions/uudec" name="here (uudec)">.
It needs uudecode and ImageMagick's display. The latter can be
replaced by any image viewer that can get input from standard 
input. The script could also be modified to use temporary 
files instead of standard input.

The google_msgid.pl script is to be found 
<url url="http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/home/sylpheed/actions/google_msgid.pl" name="here (google_msgid.pl)">. 
Example and script by Thorsten Maerz. Edit the script to change 
the browser (default is mozilla).

The tnef-claws bash script was written by Shawn Lamson and is 
to be found 
<url url="http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/home/sylpheed/actions/tnef-claws" name="here">.
The script is well commented. You need to have the tnef package 
already installed.

<sect1>Templates
<p>
With Sylpheed you can define mail templates to use when replying
to messages. A template can contain raw text (that will be inserted
in the composed mail without any change), and placeholders that are
replaced at composition time by the actual value of the selected
fields from the original message.
<p>
A typical use of the template could be to define the legal notice
to be appended to your messages (the usual notice that contains a
text like: "here are my own words and not those of my company, my
boss is not liable for them, bla, bla, bla").
<p>
To define a new template, in the <it>Configuration</it> menu select
the <it>Templates</it> entry and fill the form:




<p>
The name parameter is used to identify each template, this name
will then appear in the <it>Tools/Templates</it> menu in the
composition window.
The content of the <it>To</it> field will be appended to the original
content of the corresponding field in the message you are composing.
The content of the <it>Subject</it> field will replace the orignal subject
of the message you are composing.
<p>
In the upper pane, type in the text you want to put in the template,
use the <it>Symbols</it> button to open a help window that contains
the description of all the placeholders you can use in a template
(there is one for the sender, one for the date, one for the message
ID, ...), then use the <it>Register</it> button to  validate the
template. If you do not register the template, when leaving the form
the template will be canceled. To modify an existing template, select
it in the lower pane, modify its text, then use the <it>Substitute</it>
button. As you may guess, the <it>Delete</it> button removes the selected
template. Finally validate your changes with the <it>OK</it> button.
If you use the <it>Cancel</it> button, the form is closed and your changes
are lost (deleted templates are back, added templates are lost).

<p>
To use a template, open the composition window and select the template
from the <it>Tools/Templates</it> menu. You can then choose to insert
the template into your message or to completely replace the text of the
message by the template. This only affects the body of the message.
If you choose to insert the template, its text will be inserted at the
cursor location.
<p>
The placeholders are taken from the source message when replying, so
they have no meaning when composing a new message.

<sect>Handling MIME types

<sect1>How Sylpheed checks for Mime types

<p>
When attaching a file to a message (composing a new message), the
MIME type of the attached file is choosen based on the file extension
from the mapping list defined in the <it>mime.types</it> file(s).
Sylpheed defines its MIME type mapping table by loading the
system wide MIME types file, then the user file.
The systeme file is <it>SYSCONFDIR/mime.types</it> (SYSCONFDIR can
be defined a compile time), or if it does not exist, <it>/etc/mime.types</it>.
The user file is <it>$HOME/.sylpheed/mime.types</it>.
<p>
A <it>mime.types</it> file consist of one MIME type definition per line,
each definition line starting with the name of the MIME type, followed by
a space separated list of the corresponding file extensions.
The file can contain empty lines, and comments start with the <tt>#</tt>
character and close at line's end.
<p>
Following is a typical <it>mime.types</it> file (an extract of mine):

<verb>
# This file controls what Internet media types are sent to the client for
# given file extension(s).  Sending the correct media type to the client
# is important so they know how to handle the content of the file.
# The Internet media type registry is at 
# <ftp://ftp.iana.org/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/>.

</verb>

<p>
If the file can be found or has the wrong format, Sylpheed will assume
the default MIME type for all the attachments: <it>application/octet-stream</it>.
In such a case, the recipients mail client may not know what application 
to use to view the attachment.

</sect1>

<sect1>How Sylpheed handles attachments (reception)
<p>
When opening an attachment (select the attachment, right click and select
<it>Open</it>) Sylpheed uses one of the following methods to determine
the application to launch:

<itemize>
	<item>
		The attachment is an image: the application is the one defined by the
		<it>mime_image_viewer</it> variable of the common preferences configuration
		file (<it>$HOME/.sylpheed/sylpheedrc</it>). If no application is defined, or
		if the format of the definition is not valid, the default application
		command is <it>display</it> (ImageMagick viewer).
	</item>
	<item>
		The attachment is a sound file: the application is the one defined by the
		<it>mime_audio_player</it> variable of the common preferences configuration
		file (<it>$HOME/.sylpheed/sylpheedrc</it>). If no application is defined, or
		if the format of the definition is not valid, the default application
		command is <it>play</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		The attachment is a HTML file: the application is the one defined by the
		<it>uri_cmd</it> variable of the common preferences configuration
		file (<it>$HOME/.sylpheed/sylpheedrc</it>). This can also be changed in the
		<it>Common preferences</it>, by changing the <it>Web browser</it> defined
		in the <it>Other</it> tab.
	</item>
	<item>
		Any other attachment type: Sylpheed relies on <it>metamail</it> to use
		the correct application (Sylpheed starts <it>metamail</it> giving it
		the attachment file and the MIME type taken from the mail).
	</item>
</itemize>

<p>
The binding of the applications to each MIME type is defined in the
<it>mailcap</it> file. The systeme wide file is <it>/etc/mailcap</it>, 
while the user file is <it>$HOME/.mailcap</it>.

<p>
In the mailcap file, there is one definition per line, big lines
can be broken by escaping the newline with a <it>\</it> character,
the first element of the line is the MIME type, then a semi-colon,
(<it>;</it>), and finally the application to launch.
The application part (right side of the semi-colon) can contain several
shell commands separated by an escaped semi-colon (<it>\;</it>) and
the <it>%s</it> string is replaced by the name of the file when
launching the command.

<p>
Following is a typical <it>mailcap</it> file (an extract of mine):

<verb>

image/*; ee %s

video/mpeg; gtv %s
video/*; xanim %s

application/pdf; xpdf %s

text/html; dillo %s

<sect>Conversion of Other Mail Format into Sylpheed (MH Format)

<sect1>Importing Messages of mbox Format<p>
<!-- added 2001/07/20 -->
Sylpheed lets you import messages of the Mbox format from the File menu. First you create 
the mail folder where you want the messages to end up in, then you select File->import 
Mbox file. Use the browse function to select the Mbox file and the Sylpheed mail folder, 
and press Ok. And voila, there is your mail, imported.
<p>
That was easy, wasn't it?
</sect1>

<sect1>Importing from Windows Mailers (Becky!, AL-Mail, Outlook Express4, etc.)
<p>
For import possibilities of the mail folders of these and more mail programs you 
can download the program mbx2mbox at sourceforge.net. The project is located at 
<url url="http://mbx2mbox.sourceforge.net" name ="http://mbx2mbox.sourceforge.net.">

</sect>

<sect>NetNews<p>
What is netnews?<p>
Netnews, also called Usenet, is a collection of "news servers" that contain a great deal of information. News, as it is called in short, can be about anything. About making your own wine, about old cars or radios. You name it, and there probably is a newsgroup about it.<p>
This is what we will set up here. Accessing newsgroups. Note that this is different from e-mails. You can almost compare it to a mailing list, but yet the concept is a bit different.
<!-- added 2001/07/20 -->
<sect1>Adding and Deleting Servers<p>
<sect2>
Adding a news server<p>
To add a news server, go to the configuration menu and select the "create new account" option.
There you can name the news-account to anything of your liking. This is important, so you can identify the account later.<p>
In the BASIC tab, in the block 'personal information' you also can enter your own name, your e-mail address (so you can reply to news message by e-mail), optionally your organization (if you are organized at all).<p>
In the block 'Server information' you select the "News (NNTP)" protocol. Forget about "Inbox", that does not matter in this setup. Next you enter the name of the newsserver you want to connect to. You can get that name from your ISP, if you don't already have that.<p>
If you need to log into the news server, check the box next to "This server requires authentication", and then fill the fields for User ID and Password.<p>
Next step is to go to the Send tab. Since Receive is only there for e-mail, there is no need to do anything there. You can't even do anything in the Receive tab, for that matter. So, in Send you can select a few options:
<itemize>
<item>If you want a date header field added to posts
<item>If Sylpheed should generate a Message-ID
<item>If you want to add user-defined headers
</itemize>
The next items only apply to when you reply to a news message through e-mail. You can set an automatic CC, BCC or Reply-To address here. In case your ISP requires SMTP authentication, you can select the checkbox here below.<p>
The next tab, Compose, allows you to select a default signature file. This will be added to each post to the newsgroups you do.<p>
Finally, in the "Advanced" tab, you can specify the port on which Sylpheed has to connect to the news server. The default is 119, and only in rare cases you should have to do something about that.<p>
Now you click "OK" and the account is created! You can verify this by checking the folder pane in Sylpheed. There you will see a new folder created with the name of the account you entered, and (news) behind it.<p>
</sect2>
<sect2>
Deleting a news-server.<p>
If you want to delete a news-account, right-click the news-folder and select "Remove news account". After confirming that you want this to be done, the account and all files related will be removed.
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1>Subscribing and Unsubscribing to NewsGroups<p>
Okay. Here the real stuff begins. First you have to let Sylpheed load the list of news groups that is on the news system. Right-click the new NEWS folder and select "Subscribe to newsgroups". Sylpheed will tell you that the groups need to be downloaded, so sit back and wait a while. Of course, during time, new groups are added, and dead groups are removed. For this you can click the "refresh" button in the newsgroup dialog, so a new list is downloaded and you are up to date<p>
After a while the groups are loaded and displayed in a window. Now you can look up a group that is interesting, for example comp.os.linux.networking. Click the name once and then select OK. The group will be added to the news folder as a subfolder. When you now click the name of the new subfolder, Sylpheed will connect to the news server and download the headers (subject lines, in e-mail talk), to your computer. Some groups have -large- amounts of articles, so this may take a while!!<p>
</sect1>
<sect1>Reading News<p>
When the articles are displayed, in the summary view, you can click one of them to be downloaded so you can read it. This will usually go very quickly on discussion groups.<p>
If you want to respond to a message, press Alt-R (or press "Reply") and a message window will pop up, with the name of the newsgroup already in the "To" field. Depending on whether or not you selected quoting of the message, the original message will be in the body of the message already. Write away, then send, and soon the entire world will be able to read what you wrote on the subject.<p>
Starting a new message in a newsgroup is equally simple: press Alt-N (or click "New"), the name of the newsgroup is in the "To" field, and you can write your question or reply.
<sect2>A note about binary files<p>
In newsgroups you can download binary files. These are programs, images etc. Often these are posted as so called UUencoded files. Sylpheed will as upto version 0.5.1 not decode UUencoded files. You need to save these articles to disk as separate files, and use a separate decoder program, like juju, to decode the garble of text. A UUencoded file usually looks something like this:<p>
begin 666 sundown.jpg<p>
after which you will find nicely formatted blocks of characters that don't seem to mean anything.

<sect1>Changing Fonts on Menu, etc.<p>
If you want to change the font that shows the menu of Sylpheed, this is controlled by the window manager that you are using. You have to go into the setup of the window manager (KDE, Gnome, XFCE) and change the font to your desired one.<p>
Changing the font of the views of Sylpheed is done by selecting "Common preferences" in the Configuration menu. There you select the "Display" tab, and in the first section of the window you can browse the fonts available on your computer.
</sect1>
<sect1>Changing Key Binding of Short-Cut Key<p>
Sylpheed's graphical interface is based on GTK. This means that it is very simple to change the key binding (shortcut key, hotkey) for menu items. If you are used to a certain key combination from another program, you can tell Sylpheed to use that same key combination.<p>
The procedure is very simple. Suppose you want to change the key binding for getting new mail (message menu) from Alt-I to Ctrl-M.<p>
<itemize>
<item>Open the message menu with the mouse or by pressing Alt-M
<item>Select the "get new mail" option (do not click it, this will activate the function!). If you use the mouse, just move the mouse cursor over the option.
<item>Now you press Ctrl-M. You will immediately see the new key combination appear on the menu.
</itemize>
Congratulations, you have just changed a key binding. This way you can change all the options that you want. Do note that it is best to use just the alt, shift and ctrl key combinations. Several functions within Sylpheed are called up by one-key actions which are programmed in.

<sect1>Mailing Lists<p>
If you want to stay up to date on Sylpheed, and want to talk about the program with other users, you can join the mailing list.<p>
Send a mail to sylpheed-ctl@good-day.net that says<p>
<tt>subscribe Your Name</tt><p>
in the body.<p>
The server returns the mail once for the first registration request that asks the confirmation: "May I put you on this mailing list?" that includes the following phrase (this number is merely an example).<p>
<tt>confirm 84682771 Anne Shirley</tt><p>
This is a precaution for mischief like subscribing you to the list against your wish.<p>
If you received the entry confirmation mail, send a mail that includes the phrase:<p>
<tt>confirm Password(a number) Your Name</tt><p>
to the address for registration: sylpheed-ctl@good-day.net again. Then, it is considered that you have confirmed the registration and you are registered to the server.<p>
The address for posting to the list is sylpheed@good-day.net.<p>
Notice: If you lost the mail that says<p>
confirm Password(a number) Your Name<p>
or you became confused and want to do from start, do them over from the start, in other words, send<p>
<tt>subscribe Anne Shirley</tt><p>

    GNU Free Documentation License<label id="GNU Free Documentation License"/>


    <p>Version 1.1, March 2000</p>

    <p>Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
       Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
       of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
	 </p>

  <sect1>
    PREAMBLE

    <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</p>

    <p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p>

    <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

    <p>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</p>

    <p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</p>

    <p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</p>

    <p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</p>

    <p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</p>

    <p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</p>

    <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</p>

    <p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    VERBATIM COPYING

    <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p>

    <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    COPYING IN QUANTITY

    <p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</p>

    <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</p>

    <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</p>

    <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    MODIFICATIONS

    <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p>

    <p><itemize>
      <item>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
      Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
      there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if
      the original publisher of that version gives permission.
      </item>

      <item>List on the Title Page,
      as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
      authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the
      Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than
      five).
      </item>

      <item>State on the Title page
      the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
      publisher.
      </item>

      <item>Preserve all the
      copyright notices of the Document.
      </item>

      <item>Add an appropriate
      copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
      copyright notices.
      </item>

      <item>Include, immediately
      after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
      permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
      License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
      </item>

      <item>Preserve in that license
      notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover
      Texts given in the Document's license notice.
      </item>

      <item>Include an unaltered
      copy of this License.
      </item>

      <item>Preserve the section
      entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating
      at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
      Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no
      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given
      on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
      Version as stated in the previous sentence.
      </item>

      <item>Preserve the network
      location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
      Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
      locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
      based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You
      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
      </item>

      <item>In any section entitled
      "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's
      title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
      each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
      given therein.
      </item>

      <item>Preserve all the
      Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
      in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.
      </item>

      <item>Delete any section
      entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not be included in
      the Modified Version.
      </item>

      <item>Do not retitle any
      existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with
      any Invariant Section.
      </item>
    </itemize>
    
    <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</p>

    <p>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</p>

    <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</p>

    <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    COMBINING DOCUMENTS

    <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</p>

    <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</p>

    <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

    <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</p>

    <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
    
    <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</p>

    <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    TRANSLATION

    <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    TERMINATION
    
    <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

    <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <url url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" name="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">.</p>

    <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    How to use this License for your documents

    <p>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p>

<p><tt>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</tt></p>

    <p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</p>

    <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</p>
